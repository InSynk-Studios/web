### Just a dummy content

<div>
I, usually, consider myself a person who can achieve all the things that he dreams of.

I mean, if we remove all the negative banter in our heads, what can we not achieve?

I once saw a group of people talking about something that they have not achieved as something that they cannot ever achieve. This was a total bummer for me because I had achieved that thing and I knew it was possible. The biggest thing was that the person saying these things was an elderly person I respected. Hearing such words from him, made me believe even more in my opinion that anything can be achieved.

But if anything can be achieved, what stops us? Whoa, let’s not go down that road because there are multiple answers to that question.

But, when in pursuit of achieving things, we see failures. There are times when we see failures that we know we could have easily avoided if we would have “given our best”.

If we would have given our best? Then why the fuck did we not give our best in the first place? What is wrong with us? We have the skillset, and we have the experience. What is stopping us from acting? Are we just dumb pieces of shit?

Ohh btw that’s the negative banter in your head that makes you question yourself and your ability to achieve anything. This self-bullying makes you go down the rabbit hole of, “You are not good enough. It’s not your cup of tea.”

But, seriously though, why can we not act on anything if we were totally qualified to?

After a lot of digging, I finally have my answer.

- Content from your headless CMS is created or updated
- Ecommerce metadata changes (price, description, category, reviews, etc.)

```js:timeout.js
 // Before: only React events were batched.
        setTimeout(() => {
          setCount(c => c + 1);
          setFlag(f => !f);
          // React will render twice, once for each state update (no batching)
        }, 1000);

        // After: updates inside of timeouts, promises,
        // native event handlers or any other event are batched.
        setTimeout(() => {
          setCount(c => c + 1);
          setFlag(f => !f);
          // React will only re-render once at the end (that's batching!)
        }, 1000);
```

<div> And this is it!!</div>
